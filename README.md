# Self-INSTRUCT
Self-INSTRUCT is similar to [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) but with better reasoning and planning. As awesome as GPT is, it's ability to "plan" is mediocre at best (even for GPT-4.) The core idea behind Self-INSTRUCT is to improve its core planning ability by providing it with fragments of human authored [INSTRUCT](https://medium.com/@ickman/instruct-making-llms-do-anything-you-want-ff4259d4b91) sequences that GPT can pick from when doing planning. Self-INSTRUCT will also benefit from other INSTRUCT features, like the ability to avoid hallucinations.
